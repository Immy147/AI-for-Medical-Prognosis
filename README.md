# AI-for-Medical-Prognosis


AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, and recommend better treatments. This Repo will give you practical experience in applying machine learning to concrete problems in medicine.  Machine learning is a powerful tool for prognosis, a branch of medicine that specializes in predicting the future health of patients. In this Repo, you’ll walk through multiple examples of prognostic tasks. You’ll learn decision trees to model non-linear relationships, which are commonly observed in medical data, and apply them to predicting mortality rates more accurately. Finally, you’ll learn how to handle missing data, a key real-world challenge.
